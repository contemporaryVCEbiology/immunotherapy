            <h3>Module description</h3>
            <p>This section introduces immunotherapy as a fourth pillar of treatment for cancer. Immunotherapy uses a patient’s own immune responses to fight cancer. The use of immunotherapy to treat cancer has been evolving rapidly over the last couple of decades.</p>
            <p>Adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT), employing a patient’s own cultured T cells, is an emerging treatment of a variety of cancers. In ACT, the patient's T-cells are removed in a process known as apheresis. The T-cells known to fight the particular cancer in the patient are grown in a laboratory and inserted back into the patient’s body. Recently there has been the evolution of CAR T-cells. CAR stands for chimeric antigen receptors, which is a type of antigen-targeted receptor that has been genetically engineered onto a patient’s own T-cell. The use of genetic engineering approaches to insert antigen-targeted receptors of defined specificity into T cells has greatly enhanced the potential capabilities of ACT. These CAR T-cells are better able to seek out and kill specific target cells (Magee 2014).</p>
            <p>The module starts with the use of a hook, to engage and motivate learners to want to understand how T-cell therapies work in the treatment of cancer. The hook is a video about Emily Whitehead, the first child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to be treated with CAR T-cell therapy, with amazing results.</p>

The video highlights the challenges of immunotherapy such as the balance of stimulating the immune system to fight cancer without attacking the rest of the body, and the idea of using immunotherapy to maintain immunity against cancer. It is a good video if students require additional scaffolding information about immunotherapy in general.</p>

    <h5>Background and resources</h5>
    <p>At the age of 5, Emily was diagnosed with a type of blood cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia or ALL. Although this is currently the most treatable leukemia in children, with around 90% cure rates, Emily relapsed after 16 months of chemotherapy with a highly resistant disease and was given just a few weeks/months to live. She was then enrolled on a clinical trial at the Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania. She was the first child to be given T cells genetically reprogrammed to recognize cancer cells, which were developed at the University of Pennsylvania. Emily is still in remission and is leading a happy and healthy life (Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy Centre, University of Birmingham 2016).</p>

        <p>Teachers can choose to use one or all of the following activities: a mind map, think-pair-share, and listing pros and cons.</p>

        <h6>Whole class mind map</h6>
        <p>Create a whole-class mind map about students' understanding of immunotherapy within the scope of the case study of Emily Whitehead. Suggested mind map headings could be, but are not limited to: Immunotherapy, CAR T-cells, Cancer, Clinical Trials. Place the mind map on the classroom wall for the duration of the unit.</p>

        <h6>Think-pair-share</h6>
        <p>Students undertake a collaborative activity to answer the question(s): What is immunotherapy? What is CAR T-cell therapy? Students think individually about the question(s), undertake independent research and then share ideas with a classmate. This activity could be used for students who have difficulty in sharing within a whole-class forum.

        <h6>Pros and Cons</h6>
        <p>Students list the pros and cons of using CAR T-cell therapy. This list can be generated by the individual or from group discussion. Use additional supporting information, such as the article ‘6 questions in immunotherapy’ to scaffold discussions. </p>

This activity is designed to build from the previous case study, identifying the key steps in adoptive T-cell therapy. Students will watch a range of videos and read a number of articles and then (either individually or in groups) visualize the process of Adoptive T-cell therapy through a range of strategies.</p>
