    <h2>Adaptive immune responses</h2>
    <p class="intro">The third module within SEQUENCE 1 focuses on developing an understanding of the different cells of the immune system, and their action in cell mediated and humoral responses. It is possible that this module could take approximately 2-3 hours of class time.</p>

            <h4>Module description</h4>
            <p>From the previous module, students have an understanding of how cytotoxic T-cells attack target cells as a defense mechanism to maintain a healthy body. Students can identify how medical research has moved towards harnessing and improving a person’s own defense systems as an option in the treatment of cancer.</p>
            <p>In this module, students build on their existing knowledge, and gain insight into the roles of other cells that work together in both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses to protect the body as part of adaptive immunity. They are introduced to the concept that adaptive immunity provides a long-term sustained response that has seen ongoing remission in patients successfully treated with T cell therapy.</p>

    <p><strong>Please note</strong> that Option 1 and 2 are flexible, in that the videos can be viewed by students at home, or students can complete the online modules during class time. However, the following list of activities have been identified for use in the classroom to apply and extend student’s understandings from the resources above.</p>
    <p><strong>Activities for classroom:</strong> <br>to be used in conjunction with Option 1 or 2</p>
    <div class="activity">
        <p>Activity 3.1 - <strong>Understanding the types and roles of different cells in adaptive immunity</strong> (30-40 mins)</p>
        <p>Students demonstrate an understanding of the roles of the different components of the adaptive immune system, through a choice of literacy activity or visual organizer. The following activities use the words listed in page 10 of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/contemporaryvcebiology.com-immunotherapy-resource-pack.docx">resource pack (MSWord 370KB)</a></p>
        <h6><a href="http://puzzlemaker.discoveryeducation.com/CrissCrossSetupForm.asp" target="_blank">Immunity crossword</a> (individual)</h6>
        <p>Students write their own definitions of a range of terms used within the Immunotherapy unit to date.  Terms can be gathered from a whole-class brainstorm or the list supplied in page 10 of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/contemporaryvcebiology.com-immunotherapy-resource-pack.docx">resource pack (MSWord 370KB)</a>.</p>
        <p>Evaluation options include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>peer - completing each other’s cross words and providing feedback</li>
            <li>formative - evaluating student’s current knowledge and identify any ongoing misconceptions</li>
            <li>summative - accuracy of clues for terms used in crossword.  Can be used as an alternative to a quiz</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Concept Map (individual or collaborative group)</h6>
        <p>This task involves the construction of a concept map that connects the concepts and 	terminology introduced from the immunotherapy unit to date. Students can either create a concept map using poster paper and post-it labels, or a digital resource such as <a href="http://cmap.ihmc.us/products/" target="_blank">Cmap</a>. Students connect concepts using a 	statement called a proposition, which is an understanding of the relationship between each concept. The proposition is a complete sentence that begins with the first concept and ends with the connecting concept. Students build connections between concepts.</p>
        <p>Groups can come together and share and build on each group’s connections between concepts as part of a teacher-led discussion towards creating a whole-class concept map.</p>  
    </div>
    <div class="activity">
        <p>Activity 3.2 - <strong>Modelling adaptive immunity</strong></p> <p><a href="http://www.aai.org/AAISite/media/Education/HST/Archive/2011_Rodriguez_Victor_Final.pdf" rel="external">http://www.aai.org/AAISite/media/Education/HST/Archive/2011_Rodriguez_Victor_Final.pdf</a> (p. 9-11 &amp; 21-28)</p>
        <p>Biology action modeling is a strategy that allows students to participate in active learning where they manipulate a simple materials model that simulates a dynamic biological process. The activity is done in collaborative groups of between 3-4 students.</p>
        <p>This activity involves students creating a story board, using images to illustrate how 	humoral and cell-mediated responses operate to rid the body of a pathogen and 	develop immunity against it in case of subsequent exposure.  Students are required to 	cut out and use the images of the cells to illustrate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A humoral immune response</li>
            <li>A cell mediated immune response</li>
            <li>Combined response as part of adaptive immunity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this example, students will be able to model the interaction between antigens, B-	cells, T-Cells, and antibodies. The activity above should be modified to incorporate target cells, to link the vocabulary with previous units. It can then focus on both introduced pathogens and also a person’s own cells that have become diseased as part of the concept of immunotherapy.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> This activity can be extended by asking students to create a digital animation from the storyboard, where students can also write and incorporate their own narration to support their animation. The teacher can create their own example to model to students, or alternatively use the following animation ‘<a rel="external" href="https://youtu.be/wX22y9rz4wU">Specific Immune system animation</a>’, E Grigo 2011.</p>

    <h4 class="phase"><span>Part 2</span> Adaptive immunity and cancer</h4>
    <p class="intro">In many of the previous videos and articles in Module 1 and 2, patients who were successfully treated with CAR T cell therapy did not have a reoccurrence of their specific cancer. Many scientists predict that this is due to the patient’s own immune system maintaining a sustained immune response.</p>  
    <p class="intro">Students should be able to identify and describe how a patient’s own sustained immunity (memory cells) response may be contributing to good health. The following activities allow students to explore and describe the process of sustained immunity within the realms of cancer immunotherapy.</p>

        <p>An extension of Activity 3.2: Modelling adaptive immunity. After viewing the range of videos and literature, students are asked to add to their story board, manipulating the images to simulate a sustained immunity response.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The activity will need to have images of memory lymphocytes to support the simulation.</p>
