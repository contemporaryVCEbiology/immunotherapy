        <div class="left">
            <h3>Module description</h3>
            <p>Cytotoxic T cells, also known as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are specialized white blood cells that, when activated, seek out and kill infected cells. The CAR T cells discussed in the previous module are cytotoxic T cells that have been genetically modified to improve the ability to target and kill cancer cells.</p>
            <p>In this module, students investigate the structure and actions of a cytotoxic T cells; how they detect and attack cancers cells, also known as target cells. Students engage in a number of concrete and creative activities, including being introduced to appropriate scientific vocabulary, and demonstrating their understanding of the cellular processes involved in T cell mediated killing.</p>
            <p>In the second part of the module, students are introduced to investigative research aimed at improving CAR T cell technology. Students observe videos from scientists at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI) who are involved in research to improve the efficacy of CAR T cells.</p>

                    <p>In this chapter, the authors describe how functionally effective cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are produced and how they kill target cells. The chapter outlines the process of CTL-mediated killing through antigen recognition, activation of the CTLs, delivery of the lethal hit that kills the target cells, and release of CTLs. It describes each of these steps and how they are controlled by specific molecular interactions. It provides excellent illustrations.</p>

                    <p>From 2:25 mins the presenter introduces the concept of cytotoxic T cells and the MHC I complex and the presentation of antigens within an infected cell. It describes how cytotoxic T cells have a variable portion on their receptors that bind to proteins displayed on MHC I complexes and how these activated cytotoxic T cells replicate into memory and effector T cells. It describes how the effector cytotoxic T cell binds to the antigen presented on the target cell, and then releases the enzymes perforin (which create holes in the target cell wall) and granzymes (that induce a target cell to kill itself)</p>

An activity that can be used to verify studentâ€™s understanding of the role of various cells and molecules required as part of target cell destruction.

        <p>In this activity, students are asked to create a 2-dimentional slowmation (also known as a stopmotion) animation demonstrating their understanding of how a cytotoxic T cell finds and kills a target cell. This activity promotes student creativity by encouraging the use of everyday items (such as string, beads, sand etcâ€¦) for students to construct representations of T cells, target cells, receptors and the various enzymes. Students use appropriate digital technologies outlined in: <a href="http://www.digiexplanations.com/slowmation.html" target="_blank">http://www.digiexplanations.com/slowmation.html</a>.</p>
        <p>Students should read Chapter 11 listed in the resources above (p. 231-238) prior to undertaking this activity, as the chapter clearly explains the process and provides good illustrations to support students in building their 2D models  (note: The teacher is encouraged to create their own version of a slowmation to model the process).</p>

        <p>Activity 2.7 - <strong>Visualising the research</strong></p>
        <p>In this activity, students can individually (or in small groups) watch each video and complete a visual organizer using prompt questions outlined in the table (Page 9 of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/contemporaryvcebiology.com-immunotherapy-resource-pack.docx">resource pack (MSWord 370KB)</a>.)</p>
        <p>The questions focus on the research:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>outline (purpose and hypothesis)</li>
            <li>predictions and findings</li>

        <p>Activity 2.8 - <strong>Jigsaw strategyl</strong></p>
        <p>In an adaptation of activity 2.7, students use a jigsaw strategy to evaluate and describe the T cell research.</p>
        <p>The Jigsaw teaching strategy is an effective method for students to learn large amounts of content in a self-directed way. Students are put into groups of four. One representative from each group will watch one of the above videos, working together to analyse and summarise the information using the visual organizer table outlined in page 9 of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/contemporaryvcebiology.com-immunotherapy-resource-pack.docx">resource pack (MSWord 370KB)</a>.</p>
        <p>They then return to their groups, where they will share the information with their group, teaching the other three students about what they have learnt.</p>

        <p>Activity 2.9 - <strong>How is research into lymphocyte cell biology improving T cell therapy?</strong></p>
        <p>In this teacher-led activity, students create a whole-class mind map to describe the research and how it is improving T cell therapy. The class adds to the mind map after each video.</p>
